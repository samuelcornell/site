abstract: 'Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has rapidly
  been adopted to deliver health care services around the world. To date, studies
  have not compared people’s experiences with telehealth services during the pandemic
  in Australia to their experiences with traditional in-person visits. Objective:
  This study aimed to compare participants’ perceptions of telehealth consults to
  their perceptions of traditional in-person visits and investigate whether people
  believe that telehealth services would be useful after the pandemic. Methods: A
  national, cross-sectional, community survey was conducted between June 5 and June
  12, 2020 in Australia. In total, 1369 participants who were aged ≥18 years and lived
  in Australia were recruited via targeted advertisements on social media (ie, Facebook
  and Instagram). Participants responded to survey questions about their telehealth
  experience, which included a free-text response option. A generalized linear model
  was used to estimate the adjusted relative risks of having a poorer telehealth experience
  than a traditional in-person visit experience. Content analysis was performed to
  determine the reasons why telehealth experiences were worse than traditional in-person
  visit experiences. Results: Of the 596 telehealth users, the majority of respondents
  (n=369, 61.9%) stated that their telehealth experience was “just as good as” or
  “better than” their traditional in-person medical appointment experience. On average,
  respondents perceived that telehealth would be moderately useful to very useful
  for medical appointments after the COVID-19 pandemic ends (mean 3.67, SD 1.1). Being
  male (P=.007), having a history of both depression and anxiety (P=.016), and lower
  patient activation scores (ie, individuals’ willingness to take on the role of managing
  their health/health care) (P=.036) were significantly associated with a poor telehealth
  experience. In total, 6 overarching themes were identified from free-text responses
  for why participants’ telehealth experiences were poorer than their traditional
  in-person medical appointment experiences, as follows: communication is not as effective,
  limitations with technology, issues with obtaining prescriptions and pathology results,
  reduced confidence in their doctor, additional burden for complex care, and inability
  to be physically examined. Conclusions: Based on our sample’s responses, telehealth
  appointment experiences were comparable to traditional in-person medical appointment
  experiences. Telehealth may be worthwhile as a mode of health care delivery while
  the pandemic continues, and it may continue to be worthwhile after the pandemic.'
