 abstract = {Objective. Chronic pain and cardiovascular disease (CVD) have a high disease burden. This research aimed to understand whether Australian primary health networks (PHNs) are recognising the need for the prevention of these conditions by investigating what local health and service issues have been identified.
Methods. Separate sets of needs assessments were analysed for chronic pain and CVD for all 31 PHNs using a document analysis approach. Framework analysis was undertaken to ascertain the types of health and service issues, prevention-related issues and supporting data sources identified, as well as to quantify the number of PHNs identifying these issues.
Results. Fewer PHNs identified health issues for chronic pain (n ¼ 13) compared with CVD (n ¼ 30), with the most common being disease prevalence and burden supported by National Health Survey data. Service issues were identified by fewer than half the PHNs (n ¼ 13 for each disease), which were largely informed by stakeholder consultation and related to service integration, service accessibility and health professional training. Prevention-related issues were frequently identified for CVD (n ¼ 26), but not chronic pain (n ¼ 3).
Conclusions. This paper highlights the need for a greater focus on chronic pain- and CVD-related issues by PHNs. This could be supported nationally by recognising chronic pain and risk factors in national datasets and PHN performance frameworks, and locally via greater stakeholder consultation to inform PHN population health planning.},
