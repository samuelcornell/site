abstract: Objective. Chronic pain and cardiovascular disease (CVD) have a high disease
  burden. This research aimed to understand whether Australian primary health networks
  (PHNs) are recognising the need for the prevention of these conditions by investigating
  what local health and service issues have been identified. Methods. Separate sets
  of needs assessments were analysed for chronic pain and CVD for all 31 PHNs using
  a document analysis approach. Framework analysis was undertaken to ascertain the
  types of health and service issues, prevention-related issues and supporting data
  sources identified, as well as to quantify the number of PHNs identifying these
  issues. Results. Fewer PHNs identified health issues for chronic pain (n ¼ 13) compared
  with CVD (n ¼ 30), with the most common being disease prevalence and burden supported
  by National Health Survey data. Service issues were identified by fewer than half
  the PHNs (n ¼ 13 for each disease), which were largely informed by stakeholder consultation
  and related to service integration, service accessibility and health professional
  training. Prevention-related issues were frequently identified for CVD (n ¼ 26),
  but not chronic pain (n ¼ 3). Conclusions. This paper highlights the need for a
  greater focus on chronic pain- and CVD-related issues by PHNs. This could be supported
  nationally by recognising chronic pain and risk factors in national datasets and
  PHN performance frameworks, and locally via greater stakeholder consultation to
  inform PHN population health planning.
