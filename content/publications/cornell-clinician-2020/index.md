abstract: "Methods: Thirty‐six participants were issued with a “prescription” pad,\
  \ of 20 LRx scripts, for 1 month and requested to issue an LRx prescription to patients\
  \ they deemed suitable during their consultation, recording their reason for use\
  \ of the LRx. Each clinician was then asked to complete a comprehensive feedback\
  \ questionnaire. Results: Feedback of the LRx was overwhelmingly positive. The script\
  \ was viewed as a more effective way to convey and support cardiovascular lifestyle\
  \ advice, than usual care. Forty per cent (196 of 480) of the LRx scripts that were\
  \ provided to primary and secondary care clinicians during the study period were\
  \ issued. In most consultations, the LRx script was issued to reaffirm dietary advice.\
  \ Nurses and health care assistants were more likely than doctors to use the LRx\
  \ in response to a request for lifestyle advice from a patient. Conclusions: The\
  \ LRx may be a useful addition to the clinician's communication toolkit to stimulate\
  \ lifestyle behaviour changes in their patients. The main barrier to use in the\
  \ study was lack of consultation time."
