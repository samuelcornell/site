abstract: 'Background: Misinformation about COVID-19 is common and has been spreading
  rapidly across the globe through social media platforms and other information systems.
  Understanding what the public knows about COVID-19 and identifying beliefs based
  on misinformation can help shape effective public health communications to ensure
  efforts to reduce viral transmission are not undermined. Objective: This study aimed
  to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with COVID-19 misinformation
  in Australia and their changes over time. Methods: This prospective, longitudinal
  national survey was completed by adults (18 years and above) across April (n=4362),
  May (n=1882), and June (n=1369) 2020. Results: Stronger agreement with misinformation
  was associated with younger age, male gender, lower education level, and language
  other than English spoken at home (Ptextless.01 for all). After controlling for
  these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (Ptextless.001)
  with lower levels of digital health literacy, perceived threat of COVID-19, confidence
  in government, and trust in scientific institutions. Analyses of specific government-identified
  misinformation revealed 3 clusters: prevention (associated with male gender and
  younger age), causation (associated with lower education level and greater social
  disadvantage), and cure (associated with younger age). Lower institutional trust
  and greater rejection of official government accounts were associated with stronger
  agreement with COVID-19 misinformation. Conclusions: The findings of this study
  highlight important gaps in communication effectiveness, which must be addressed
  to ensure effective COVID-19 prevention.'
