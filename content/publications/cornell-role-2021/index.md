abstract: 'Background: Since the inception of PHNs in Australia, their role in implementing
  chronic disease prevention activities in general practice has been unclear. This
  study aimed to qualitatively explore the views of PHN staff on the role of PHNs
  in promoting prevention, with a focus on cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.
  Methods: Content analysis of PHN Needs Assessments was conducted to inform interview
  questions. Twenty-足nine semi-足structured interviews were conducted with 32 PHN staff,
  between June and December 2020, in varied roles across 18 PHNs in all Australian
  states and territories. Transcribed audio recordings were thematically coded, using
  the Framework Analysis method to ensure rigour. Results: We identified three main
  themes: (a) Informal prevention: All respondents agreed the role of PHNs in prevention
  was indirect and, for the most part, outside the formal remit of PHN Key Performance
  Indicators (KPIs.) Prevention activities were conducted in partnership with external
  stakeholders, professional development and quality improvement programs, and PHN-足funded
  data extraction and analysis software for general practice. (b) Constrained by financial
  incentives: Most interviewees felt the role of PHNs in prevention was contingent
  on the financial drivers provided by the Commonwealth government, such as Medicare
  funding and national quality improvement programs. (c) Shaped through competing
  priorities: The role of PHNs in prevention is a function of competing priorities.
  There was strong agreement amongst participants that the myriad competing priorities
  from government and local needs assessments impeded prevention activities. Conclusions:
  PHNs are well-足positioned to foster prevention activities in general practice. However,
  we found that PHNs role in prevention activities was informal, constrained by financial
  incentives and shaped through competing priorities. Prevention can be improved through
  a more explicit prevention focus at the Commonwealth government level. To optimise
  the role of PHNs, therefore, requires prioritising prevention, aligning it with
  KPIs and supporting stakeholders like general practice.'
