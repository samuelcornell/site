abstract: 'Background: Vaccination rollout against COVID-19 is underway across multiple
  countries worldwide. Although the vaccine is free, rollout might still be compromised
  by hesitancy or concerns about COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We conducted two online
  surveys of Australian adults in April (during national lockdown; convenience cross-sectional
  sample) and November (very few cases of COVID-19; nationally representative sample)
  2020, prior to vaccine rollout. We asked about intentions to have a potential COVID-19
  vaccine (If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, I will get it) and free-text responses
  (November only). Results: After adjustment for differences in sample demographics,
  the estimated proportion agreeing to a COVID-19 vaccine if it became available in
  April (n = 1146) was 76.3%. In November (n = 1941) this was estimated at 71.5% of
  the sample; additional analyses identiﬁed that the variation was driven by differences
  in perceived public health threat between April and November. Across both surveys,
  female gender, being younger, having inadequate health literacy and lower education
  were associated with reluctance to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Lower perceived
  susceptibility to COVID-19, belief that data on the efﬁcacy of vaccines is ‘largely
  made up’, having lower conﬁdence in government, and lower perception of COVID-19
  as a public health threat, were also associated with reluctance to be vaccinated
  against COVID-19. The top three reasons for agreeing to vaccinate (November only)
  were to protect myself and others, moral responsibility, and having no reason not
  to get it. For those who were indifferent or disagreeing to vaccinate, safety concerns
  were the top reason, followed by indecision and lack of trust in the vaccine respectively.
  Conclusions: These ﬁndings highlight some factors related to willingness to accept
  a COVID-19 vaccine prior to one being available in Australia. Now that the vaccine
  is being offered, this study identiﬁes key issues that can inform public health
  messaging to address vaccine hesitancy.'
