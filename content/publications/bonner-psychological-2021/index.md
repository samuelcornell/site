abstract: 'Background: It is unclear how people with hypertension are responding to
  the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased risk, and whether targeted public health
  strategies are needed. Objective: This retrospective case-control study compared
  people with hypertension to matched healthy controls during the COVID-19 lockdown
  to determine whether they have higher risk perceptions, anxiety, and vaccination
  intentions. Methods: Baseline data from a national survey were collected in April
  2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown in Australia. People who reported hypertension
  with no other chronic conditions were randomly matched to healthy controls of similar
  age, gender, education, and health literacy level. A subset including participants
  with hypertension was followed up at 2 months after restrictions were eased. Risk
  perceptions, anxiety, and vaccination intentions were measured in April and June.
  Results: Of the 4362 baseline participants, 466 (10.7%) reported hypertension with
  no other chronic conditions. A subset of 1369 people were followed up at 2 months,
  which included 147 (10.7%) participants with hypertension. At baseline, perceived
  seriousness was high for both hypertension and control groups. The hypertension
  group reported greater anxiety compared to the controls and were more willing to
  vaccinate against influenza, but COVID-19 vaccination intentions were similar. At
  follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the longitudinal subsample.
  Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccination intentions for
  both influenza and COVID-19 remained high across groups (textgreater80%). Conclusions:
  Anxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. It was higher in the
  hypertension group, which also had higher vaccination intentions. Groups that are
  more vulnerable to COVID-19 may require targeted mental health screening during
  periods of greater risk. Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after
  2 months of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions remained high, which is
  encouraging for the future prevention of COVID-19.'
