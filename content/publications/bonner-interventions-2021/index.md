abstract: 'Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk communication is a challenge
  for clinical practice, where physicians find it difficult to explain the absolute
  risk of a CVD event to patients with varying health literacy. Converting the probability
  to heart age is increasingly used to promote lifestyle change, but a rapid review
  of biological age interventions found no clear evidence that they motivate behavior
  change. Objective: In this review, we aim to identify the content and effects of
  heart age interventions. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies presenting
  heart age interventions to adults for CVD risk communication in April 2020 (later
  updated in March 2021). The Johanna Briggs risk of bias assessment tool was applied
  to randomized studies. Behavior change techniques described in the intervention
  methods were coded. Results: From a total of 7926 results, 16 eligible studies were
  identified; these included 5 randomized web-based experiments, 5 randomized clinical
  trials, 2 mixed methods studies with quantitative outcomes, and 4 studies with qualitative
  analysis. Direct comparisons between heart age and absolute risk in the 5 web-based
  experiments, comprising 5514 consumers, found that heart age increased positive
  or negative emotional responses (4/5 studies), increased risk perception (4/5 studies;
  but not necessarily more accurate) and recall (4/4 studies), reduced credibility
  (2/3 studies), and generally had no effect on lifestyle intentions (4/5 studies).
  One study compared heart age and absolute risk to fitness age and found reduced
  lifestyle intentions for fitness age. Heart age combined with additional strategies
  (eg, in-person or phone counseling) in applied settings for 9582 patients improved
  risk control (eg, reduced cholesterol levels and absolute risk) compared with usual
  care in most trials (4/5 studies) up to 1 year. However, clinical outcomes were
  no different when directly compared with absolute risk (1/1 study). Mixed methods
  studies identified consultation time and content as important outcomes in actual
  consultations using heart age tools. There were differences between people receiving
  an older heart age result and those receiving a younger or equal to current heart
  age result. The heart age interventions included a wide range of behavior change
  techniques, and conclusions were sometimes biased in favor of heart age with insufficient
  supporting evidence. The risk of bias assessment indicated issues with all randomized
  clinical trials. Conclusions: The findings of this review provide little evidence
  that heart age motivates lifestyle behavior change more than absolute risk, but
  either format can improve clinical outcomes when combined with other behavior change
  strategies. The label for the heart age concept can affect outcomes and should be
  pretested with the intended audience. Future research should consider consultation
  time and differentiate between results of older and younger heart age.'
