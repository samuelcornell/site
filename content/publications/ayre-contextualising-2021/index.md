abstract: 'Background In Australia in March 2020 a national public health directive
  required that non-essential workers stay at home, except for essential activities.
  These restrictions began easing in May 2020 as community transmission slowed.   Objectives
  This study investigated changes in COVID prevention behaviours from April-July 2020,
  and psychosocial predictors of these behaviours.   Methods An Australia-wide (national)
  survey was conducted in April, with monthly follow-up over four months. Participants
  who were adults (18+ years), currently residing in Australia and who could read
  and understand English were eligible. Recruitment was via online social media. Analysis
  sample included those who provided responses to the baseline survey (April) and
  at least one subsequent follow-up survey (N = 1834 out of a possible 3216 who completed
  the April survey). 71.7% of the sample was female (n = 1,322). Principal components
  analysis (PCA) combined self-reported adherence across seven prevention behaviours.
  PCA identified two behaviour types: ‘distancing’ (e.g. staying 1.5m away) and ‘hygiene’
  (e.g. washing hands), explaining 28.3% and 24.2% of variance, respectively. Distancing
  and hygiene behaviours were analysed individually using multivariable regression
  models.   Results On average, participants agreed with statements of adherence for
  all behaviours (means all above 4 out of 7). Distancing behaviours declined each
  month (p’s textless .001), whereas hygiene behaviours remained relatively stable.
  For distancing, stronger perceptions of societal risk, self-efficacy to maintain
  distancing, and greater perceived social obligation at baseline were associated
  with adherence in June and July (p’stextless0.05). For hygiene, the only significant
  correlate of adherence in June and July was belief that one’s actions could prevent
  infection of family members (p textless .001).   Conclusion High adherence to COVID
  prevention behaviours were reported in this social media sample; however, distancing
  behaviours tended to decrease over time. Belief in social responsibility may be
  an important aspect to consider in encouraging distancing behaviours. These findings
  have implications for managing a shift from government-imposed restrictions to individual
  responsibility.'
