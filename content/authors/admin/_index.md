I am a PhD student working with the [Beach Safety Research Group](https://www.beachsafetyresearch.com/sam-cornell) üèñÔ∏è üî¨to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of using location-based social media üì± safety messaging, at dangerous aquatic locations, to reduced injuries and fatalities.

My project aims to determine the incidence of, and causal factors associated with, injuries and fatalities that occur in Australian aquatic locations that are frequented by Instagram users. I will co-design place-based safety messages that alert users to present geographical hazards, and then evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of these messages by social media users.

I previously worked with the University of Sydney [Health Literacy Lab](https://www.sydneyhealthliteracylab.org.au/lab) across multiple projects including cardiovascular disease risk assessment and COVID-19 research.

I am a believer of open-science research practices, and a promoter of public engagement of science. I strive to communicate science effectively to promote greater understanding and knowledge across all communities.
