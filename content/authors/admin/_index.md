I am a PhD student working with the [Beach Safety Research Group](https://www.beachsafetyresearch.com/sam-cornell) üèñÔ∏è üî¨to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of using location-based social media üì± safety messaging at dangerous aquatic locations. 

My project aims to determine the incidence of, and causal factors associated with, injuries and fatalities¬†that occur in Australian aquatic locations that are frequented Instagram users as well as co-design place-based safety messages that alert users, and then to effectiveness and acceptability¬†of such messages.

I previously worked with the University of Sydney Health Literacy Lab across multiple projects including cardiovacular disease risk assessment and COVID-19 research.
