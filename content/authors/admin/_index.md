I am currently working across a few projects all related to public health including a [cardiovascular disease risk asssessment implementation trial](https://auscvdrisk.com.au/), and working with the [Beach Safety Research Group](https://www.beachsafetyresearch.com/sam-cornell)  to determine the first-hand effects of being caught in a rip current.
